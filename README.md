# EVA - EV3 Accessibility Firmware
This project is intended to modify the existing vanilla developer firmware 
to provide accessibility options for users with visual impairments as well 
as sighted users.


## Development
As of now, the project is mainly developed on Linux Mint, via terminal based
editors ( I know primitive ). As per the Lego documentation, it is possible
to develop using Eclipse Helios and a virtual machine. In the long run,
Linux based development seems to be ideal.
