    da830/omap-l137: Configure LCD_AC_ENB_CS pin as LCD for Char LCD
    
    Commit ID f0e2b46daa879978c01868d38989bac96b9ece45 had
    configured the LCD_AC_ENB_CS pin as GPIO for Graphical
    LCD to work on AM1707 parts. But this had caused Character
    LCD not to work which requires the LCD_AC_ENB_CS pin to be
    functioning as LCD. This patch configures the LCD_AC_ENB_CS
    pin as LCD incase Character LCD is enabled.

    The da8xx/omap-l1 boards refuse to build when CONFIG_DAVINCI_MUX is undefined
    because arch/arm/mach-davinci/mux.c:da8xx_pinmux_setup() is not defined.
    
    This patch fixes this issue. This is build tested with davinci_all_defconfig
    and da8xx_omapl_defconfig and boot tested on DA830 EVM.

    tvp514x: Fix S_INPUT behavior
    
    Currently, TVP514x goes to Power-Save mode when STREAMOFF
    ioctl is called from application and it comes out of
    Power-Save mode when STREAMON ioctl is called. But with
    this S_INPUT ioctl fails because this ioctl is dependant
    on some TVP514x status registers which reflect correct
    status only when TVP514x is not in Power-Save mode.
    
    This patch brings TVP514x out of Power-Save mode when
    application calls S_INPUT ioctl.

    fb: da8xx: fix LCD becoming non-responsive after multiple suspends
    
    It is observed that LCD becomes non-responsive (does not
    take new data) after multiple suspend resume operations.
    This patch fixes that issue.
    
    In suspend:
    1) After disabling raster, wait for current frame to finish
       before disabling LCD module clock.
    2) Power down the panel after raster is disabled.
    
    On resume, enable the LCD module before panel is powered up.

    da850: GLCD: Workaround for LCDC Underflow During Initialization
    
    During LCDC initialization, there is the potential for a FIFO
    underflow condition to occur. A FIFO underflow condition
    occurs when the input FIFO is completely empty and the LCDC
    raster controller logic that drives data to the output pins
    attempts to fetch data from the FIFO. When a FIFO underflow
    condition occurs, incorrect data will be driven out on the
    LCDC data pins.
    
    Software should poll the FUF bit field in the LCD_STAT register
    to check if an error condition has occurred or service the
    interrupt if FUF_EN is enabled when FUF occurs. If the FUF bit
    field has been set to 1, this will indicate an underflow
    condition has occurred and then the software should execute a
    reset of the LCDC via the LPSC.
    
    This problem may occur if the LCDC FIFO threshold size
    (LCDDMA_CTRL[TH_FIFO_READY]) is left at its default value after
    reset. Increasing the FIFO threshold size will reduce or
    eliminate underflows. Setting the threshold size to 256 double
    words or larger is recommended.

    The code makes use of the accelerated "generic RNDIS" DMA mode, falling back to
    the transparent (packet per transfer) mode if the hardware restrictions prevent
    it from using the accelerated mode.

    USB: gadget: use ep5 for bulk-in and ep6 for bulk-out for Blackfin MUSB
    
    Normally, the musb uses ep1 as the bidirectional bulk endpoint.  This won't
    work on the Blackfin musb as all endpoints (except ep0) are unidirectional.
    Further, ep1-ep4 have a small 128 byte FIFO which makes them undesirable
    for bulk endpoints (which need more like a 512 byte FIFO).  This leaves us
    with ep5-ep7 which have 1024 byte FIFOs and can be configured as either
    in/out and bulk/interrupt/iso on the fly.

    usb: musb: Fix cppi_channel_abort() function to handle Txabort correctly
    
    This patch fixes the Tx abort/teardown logic. We now wait for the teardown
    completion interrupt and acknowledge the same by setting the tx_complete
    register to 0.
    
    This change is needed to ensure that abort processing works on DM365 platform.
    Without this change after completion of abort processing the system is
    overwhelmed with continuous stream of abort interrupts.
    
    This change has been tested on all CPPI3.x platforms (DM644x, DM646x, DM35x,
    DM36x).

    usb: musb: workaround toggle bug when doing bulk transferafter isoc
    
    This patch implements the work around for a Mentor controller related
    bug where it's observed a BULK Tx toggle error on the bus when a
    BULK IO gets scheduled on an endpoint that was earlier used for
    handling ISOC transaction and needed to start on 1 toggle.  When such
    a situation arises even if the TXCSR toggle bits are programmed
    correctly by the musb driver the data gets transmitted with 0 toggle
    which leads to toggle error on the bus and the BULK transaction fails.
    In case of MSC write, the device gets reset by the Host.
    
    This Mentor bug is observed on almost all Mentor versions (1.3, 1.5,
    1.8).  Confirmed on DM644x, DM355, DM365, OMAPL13x platforms.

    PATCH/USB,
    
    MUSB DMA_INTR register may sometimes read zero when infact there
    was a pending interrupt. Workaround this by reading the DMA_COUNT
    values for all enabled channels when this condition occurs.
    Flag these channels as the ones needing to be serviced.
    
    Additionally, the absence of a debug print meant we would never
    catch a spurious DMA interrupt in MUSB. So this patch adds a
    debug print in the IRQ handler.

    Silicon team has confirmed an errata where in all the active

    So far we have observed the issue in above use case scenario.
    
    As a workaround to it, adding a new FIFO config (5) fitting well
    within first 8K which can be used for such use cases.

    Note that this problem will not be detected on DA850 EVM since the I2C0
    used on the EVM derives its input from a fixed clock.

    i2c: davinci: Correct I2C initialization sequence during xfer
    
    Commit e99f59bd6c3558803fc7f237743e9a4ae175994b introduces an
    i2c write in i2c_davinci_xfer_msg() function before setting
    the I2C mode register, which results in undefined behavior.
    This patch corrects this sequence by setting the I2C mode
    register before starting any I2C transaction.

    OHCI: DA8xx/OMAP-L1x glue layer (take 3)
    
        [Download message RAW]
    
        Texas Instruments DA8xx/OMAP-L1x OHCI glue layer.
    
        This OHCI implementation is not without quirks: there's only one physical port
        despite the root hub reporting two; the port's power control and over-current
        status bits are not connected to any pins, however, at least on the DA830 EVM
        board, those signals are connected via GPIO, thus the provision was made for
        overriding the OHCI port power and over-current bits at the board level...

    It seems phy_start_machine() needlessly reinitialized work
    struct. This is OK for ucc_geth and gianfar driver because
    these drivers do not detach PHYs on suspend, but TI davinci
    does. :-/

    nand: davinci: add support for aemif timing configuration
    
    This patch adds support for configuring AEMIF timing values
    during NAND flash init.
    
    Earlier, AEMIF configuration was being done as a special case
    for DM644x board, but now more boards emerge which have capability
    to boot for other media (SPI flash, NOR flash) and have the kernel
    access NAND flash. This means that kernel cannot always  depend on
    the bootloader to setup the NAND.
    
    Also, on platforms such as da850/omap-l138, the aemif input
    frequency changes as cpu frequency changes; necessiating
    re-calculation of timimg values as part of cpufreq transtitions.
    This patch forms the basis for adding that support.

    This patch adds support to configure the AEMIF interface
    for user supplied timing values.
    
    Since this capability is useful both from NOR and NAND
    flashes, it is provided as a new interface in a file of
    its own.

    davinci: da850/omap-l138 evm: account for defdcdc{2,3} being tied high
    
    Per the da850/omap-l138 Beta EVM SOM schematic, the defdcdc2 and
    defdcdc3 lines are tied high by default. This leads to a 3.3V IO
    and 1.2V CVDD voltage.
    
    For the TPS6507x driver, it means that the DEFDCDC_HIGH registers
    need to be read/written instead of DEFDCDC_LOW register. The tps6507x
    driver added this functionality recently. This patch passes the right
    platform data to the TPS6507x which tells it that the HIGH register
    needs to be read instead of the LOW register.

    Regulator: Check which register needs to be read for DCDC2/3
    
    In TPS6507x, for DCDC2/3, either DEFDCDC2_LOW or DEFDCDC2_HIGH
    can be read depending on the status of DEFDCDC2 pin. Since this
    pin cannot be read through register, this information is passed
    through board-evm file and the driver appropriately checks it
    before reading the LOW / HIGH register.

    Current EDMA driver is not taking care of EDMA channels/slots
    which are allocated from other processor, say DSP. If a
    channel/slot is allocated from DSP, the existing EDMA driver
    can still allocate the same resource on ARM.
    
    This patch enables the user to pass the channel/slots reserved
    for DSP as platform data. EDMA driver scans this list during
    probe and prepares a bitmap of channel/slots which can be used
    on ARM side.
