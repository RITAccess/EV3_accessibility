    da850/omapl138: Correct "mmc rescan" implementation
    
    Earlier "mmc rescan" command from U-Boot prompt would always
    return ZERO, hence it was not possible to use this command to
    know whether the MMC/SD card is present in the slot or not.
    This patch corrects this issue.
    
    In the process, modify the bootargs to include a check to find
    whether the MMC/SD card is present or not.

    Multiblock Support for MMC
    
    Added Multi-Block Read support for MMC. Modified existing multi-block write
    to limit the maximum number of blocks per transfer.  This feature is enabled
    with CONFIG_MMC_MBLOCK option.  A new member is added in the mmc structure
    for the host controllers to specify the maximum number of blocks it supports.
    If the feature is disabled all read/write transfers are single-block.

    da8xx/omap-l1xx: Modify default bootargs and bootcmd
    
    Starting from kernel 2.6.24 'rootwait' can be used to wait for
    the rootdevice to become ready, this is preferred over choosing
    a random delay.
    
    In the case of da8xx/omap-l1xx the delay is dependant on the MMC
    card present and can take more than 10 seconds in some cases.
