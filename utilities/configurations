AM1808:
	After failing to run build_kernel, I finally figured out some issues.
	PRU binaries can be found in d_uart/pru...
	Necessary to compile ( provides lex scanners I think )

	Also found necessary libraries to compile with the package:  gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
	Had to modify the build_kernel script to use the compiler, but it is the same compiler
	jst labeled differently.
